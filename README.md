A touch of China app with facebook login
I implemented an app about two basic things about Chinese culture.
I implemented a tutorial pages at the begining of the app. Telling about the functions and instructions of this app.
Basicly user input your birth year and click Ok button , user can see the corresponding picture of his/her zodiac figure. user can clicl the login button below to login to facebook. Also I tried to fetch user data like firends etc. after login, I print the email of the user in the console. Then user click next to the next page,shake your phone to get a random Chinese name. You can shake again if you don't like it.
